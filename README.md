### "winch is not cloud, hehe"

This is a project to integrate Puppet, The Foreman and OpenStack. It is similar in some ways to https://github.com/redhat-openstack/astapor but we've made our own choices, e.g we want to use Hiera for providing data for Puppet, not the Foreman ENC.

We are writing some documentation to introduce people to OpenStack and its related Puppet code. This documentation is kept in the docs/ folder and is also viewable from

http://norcams.viewdocs.io/winch

As our teams work their way through learning the various OpenStack components more documentation will be added. The planned sessions (and docu) so far is

* Keystone - OpenStack Identity Service
* Glance - OpenStack Image Service
* Nova - OpenStack Compute
* Swift - OpenStack Object Storage (think Amazon S3)
* Cinder - OpenStack Block Storage (think Amazon EBS)
* Networking
  - Nova-network
  - Neutron
* Horizon - OpenStack Dashboard
* Gluster as storage
* The Foreman

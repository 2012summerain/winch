*winch installs openstack juno*

This is a project to integrate Puppet, The Foreman and OpenStack. It is
similar in some ways to https://github.com/redhat-openstack/astapor but
we've made our own choices, e.g we want to use Hiera for providing data
for Puppet, not the Foreman ENC.

We are writing some documentation to introduce people to OpenStack and
its related Puppet code. This documentation is kept in the docs/ folder
and is also available at https://winch.readthedocs.org

As our teams work their way through learning the various OpenStack
components more documentation will be added.

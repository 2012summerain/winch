Checking out the project
========================

Having installed the requirements we're now ready to check out and
browse around the project to look at how it is structured.

Cloning from GitHub
-------------------

Since this is a public project we keep a copy of its source on GitHub.
This is not the only copy or even an authorative one but we will keep it
updated to reflect the current status of the project.

::

    git clone https://github.com/norcams/winch

This will make a full clone of the source repository and store it on
your local computer.

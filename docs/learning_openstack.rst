Learning Openstack
==================

WIP

To learn about Openstack services and architecture there is no shortcut,
you have to do a lot of reading and careful studying of the concepts.
Documentation at this point (early 2014) is not always up to date and
you often end up having to read about a topic from several sources to
find answers. This is of course challenging but at the same time a good
thing, as different perspectives will give you a broader learning
experience.

The main source of documentation is http://docs.openstack.org/

Planning your path
------------------

We recommend learning Openstack service by service, then trying to
understand how the pieces work together as you go. Rather than writing
our own documentation in full we've collected a number of external
resources below to help people get started. 

Openstack is a large project and to deploy it as a service require
mastering all infrastructure layers. Depending on your background it
might take a while to gain the needed knowledge.

To our best judgement any engineer without superhero powers would need
at least three months full time to become proficient doing just *basic*
deployment and operations. YMMV of course :^)
